                <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">A junior software developer recently graduated from Codeclan, I have a background of 9 years in Investment Banking Operations across various roles. 
                    I am used to working in a high volume and fast paced environment, I am a quick learner and love to tackle and solve problems. 
                </p> 
                <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
                  I initially explored software development through self-learning as a hobby and then opted to pursue a career change via CodeClanâ€™s Software Development course 
                   and I am now eager to build upon my new skills as I grow my career as a developer.
                </p>
                <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
                  The CodeClan course was an intensive full time 16-week bootcamp covering fundamentals of development in Python, Javascript & Java. I completed over 800 hours of coding, finishing 2 solo projects and a group project in the process.
