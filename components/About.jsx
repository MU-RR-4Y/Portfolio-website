                <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">A junior software developer recently graduated from Codeclan, I have a background of 9 years in Investment Banking Operations across various roles. 
                   Used to working in a high volume and fast paced environment, I am a quick learner and problem solver. This makes me adaptable to any situation.
                </p> 
                <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
                   I became aware of software development while working on projects within my prior roles and I quickly took an interest in the area. 
                   I initially explored self learning as a hobby and then opted to pursue a career change via CodeClanâ€™s Software Development course 
                   and I am now eager to build upon my new skills as I grow my career as a developer.
